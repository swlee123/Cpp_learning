# C++_learnning

Back in February 2022 , I started to pick up C++ (to prepare for my university course : C++ Object Oriented Programming)

## Learning Sources

My main learning sources is by watching Youtube Videos by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/featured) C++ series and reading documentation on [Cpp Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/), this series is so good that I recommended it to my friends.

**C++ Primer** Plus is also one of my learning sources, together with **GeeksforGeeks,W3School** and many others tutoriol websites.
